Code of IEEE TNNLS 2022 "Fast Incomplete Multi-view Clustering with View-independent Anchors"

Please run the 'run.m', and reproduce the results on 'ORL_mtv' datasets.

Any problem can contact suyuanliu@nudt.edu.cn. Thanks.

Motivations:
1. The concept learing would derivate far from the distribution of the original real data due to the disturb of missing data,
2. In NMF, few of existing methods pay attention to the semantic correlations between anchor bases and cluster centroids
